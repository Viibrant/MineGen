# ðŸ’Ž MineGen: Minecraft Schematic Generator ðŸš§

## About <a name = "about"></a>

MineGen is a project that uses deep learning and transformers to generate schematic files for Minecraft. The goal of this project is to create a tool that can generate unique and interesting building structures for players to use in their world.
